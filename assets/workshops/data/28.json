We are in need of an alternative energy source. The most abundant renewable source in the world is the sun. Therefore, in coming future, there will be a huge demand for engineers who are well versed in solar. But, the institutions are lagging in inculcating the required knowledge to the students. Therefore, it can be learned only through practical exposure which is made available in this workshop."},
